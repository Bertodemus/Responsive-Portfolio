# CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is my rendering of responsive based on set parameters and reference images.

## Overview

* Responsive design consists of: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Bootstrap 4 was utilized to create:

   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images

* PROCESS NOTES: I include some comments that I have titled as `PROCESS NOTES:`. I utilize these comments to show understanding of the content and/or to explain ceratin code design decisions.

### Bonus

* A `sticky` footer is included and there are neseted `rows` and `columns`.

* The `FORM` in the `CONTACT` page is functional. You can submit your entries.
